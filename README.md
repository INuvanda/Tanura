# Tanura

A proper videoconferencing system based on webRTC.

Tanura is a project to make videoconferencing with webRTC more enjoyable.  With 
a multiple document interface and the ability to have large conference rooms, 
in-browser videoconferencing can finally match natively installed software.  And 
thanks to the mobile-first design and low bandwidth requirements, it can help 
you be productive anywhere.  Tanura aims to finally bring you 
a videoconferencing solution, that feels like it belongs in the 21st century.

## Project status

Tanura is pre-alpha software. You will encounter build failures, breaking 
changes are likely. Do not use in a production environment.
